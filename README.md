# Welcome to DanLearnings! ðŸ‘‹

Hello there! This is my digital laboratory, a space dedicated to practicing, studying, and exploring new technologies and software development concepts.

## ðŸš€ About This Organization

The goal of `DanLearnings` is to serve as a living portfolio of my learning journey. Here you will find projects, proofs-of-concept, and practical exercises that I'm developing to deepen my knowledge in software architecture, DevOps, and various programming languages.

## ðŸ“‚ Current Flagship Project: The Book Catalog Ecosystem

I am currently building a complete microservices ecosystem from scratch. The goal is to design, develop, and deploy a fully functional "Book Catalog" application using modern best practices. You can follow the progress in the following repositories:

- **ðŸ“š [book-catalog](https://github.com/DanLearnings/book-catalog):** (SOON) The project's main entrypoint, containing all architectural documentation.

Feel free to explore, open issues, or reach out to exchange ideas!
