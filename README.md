# Welcome to DanLearnings! 👋

Hello there! This is my digital laboratory, a space dedicated to practicing, studying, and exploring new technologies and software development concepts.

## 🚀 About This Organization

The goal of `DanLearnings` is to serve as a living portfolio of my learning journey. Here you will find projects, proofs-of-concept, and practical exercises that I'm developing to deepen my knowledge in software architecture, DevOps, and various programming languages.

## 📂 Current Flagship Project: The Book Catalog Ecosystem

I am currently building a complete microservices ecosystem from scratch. The goal is to design, develop, and deploy a fully functional "Book Catalog" application using modern best practices. You can follow the progress in the following repositories:

- **📚 [book-catalog](https://github.com/DanLearnings/book-catalog):** (SOON) The project's main entrypoint, containing all architectural documentation.
- **⚙️ [book-catalog-api](https://github.com/DanLearnings/book-catalog-api):** (SOON) The backend API (Java/Spring Boot).
- **🖥️ [book-catalog-frontend](https://github.com/DanLearnings/book-catalog-frontend):** (SOON) The frontend application (Angular).
- **🚀 [book-catalog-orquestracao](https://github.com/DanLearnings/book-catalog-orquestracao):** (SOON) The orchestration and deployment layer (Docker/GitHub Actions).

Feel free to explore, open issues, or reach out to exchange ideas!
