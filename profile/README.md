## 🚀 About This Organization

The goal of **DanLearnings** is to serve as a living portfolio of my learning journey. Here you will find real-world projects, proofs-of-concept, and hands-on exercises designed to deepen my expertise in:

- **Microservices Architecture**
- **Cloud-Native Development** (Spring Cloud, Docker, Kubernetes)
- **Event-Driven Systems** (RabbitMQ, Kafka)
- **DevOps & CI/CD Practices**
- **API Design & Integration Patterns**
- **Full-Stack Development**
- **Database Design & Optimization**

## 📚 Active Projects

### 1. 📚 **Book Catalog Ecosystem** (In Development)

A complete microservices ecosystem for managing a book catalog, designed from scratch to demonstrate modern architectural patterns and best practices.

**Repository:** [book-catalog](https://github.com/DanLearnings/book-catalog) *(Coming Soon)*

**Focus Areas:**
- Clean Architecture principles
- Domain-Driven Design (DDD)
- CQRS and Event Sourcing patterns
- RESTful API design
- Database modeling and optimization

### 2. 🛒 **E-commerce Microservices Ecosystem** (Active Development)

A production-grade e-commerce platform showcasing the complete lifecycle of distributed systems—from service design to containerization, event-driven communication, and orchestration.

### 🏛️ **Main Repository:**
- **[ecommerce-ecosystem](https://github.com/DanLearnings/ecommerce-ecosystem):** The architectural hub and main entrypoint for the entire distributed system.

### 🛠️ **Microservices:**
- **[ecommerce-service-registry](https://github.com/DanLearnings/ecommerce-service-registry):** Eureka Server for service discovery
- **[ecommerce-config-server](https://github.com/DanLearnings/ecommerce-config-server):** Centralized configuration management
- **[ecommerce-api-gateway](https://github.com/DanLearnings/ecommerce-api-gateway):** API Gateway with dynamic routing
- **[ecommerce-inventory-service](https://github.com/DanLearnings/ecommerce-inventory-service):** Product catalog and inventory management
- **[ecommerce-notification-service](https://github.com/DanLearnings/ecommerce-notification-service):** Email notifications with RabbitMQ integration
- **[ecommerce-config-repo](https://github.com/DanLearnings/ecommerce-config-repo):** Git-backed configuration repository

### 🎯 **What This Project Demonstrates:**

✅ **Microservices Architecture** - Independent, scalable services  
✅ **Service Discovery** - Dynamic service registration with Eureka  
✅ **API Gateway Pattern** - Single entry point with load balancing  
✅ **Centralized Configuration** - Git-backed config management  
✅ **Event-Driven Communication** - Asynchronous messaging with RabbitMQ  
✅ **Containerization** - Docker multi-stage builds and Docker Compose orchestration  
✅ **Observability** - Health checks and monitoring with Spring Actuator  

---

## 🧪 Current Status

**Operational Services:**
- ✅ Service Registry (Eureka)
- ✅ Config Server
- ✅ API Gateway (WebFlux)

## 🔮 Future Projects

This organization will continue to grow with new projects focused on:

- **Microservices Patterns:** Circuit Breakers, Saga Pattern, API Composition
- **Cloud Platforms:** AWS, Azure, Google Cloud deployments
- **Data Engineering:** ETL pipelines, data lakes, real-time processing
- **Frontend Frameworks:** React, Angular, Vue.js with backend integration
- **Security:** OAuth2, JWT, API Security best practices
- **Performance:** Caching strategies, load testing, optimization techniques

---

## 💡 Learning Philosophy

Each project in this organization follows a structured approach:

1. **Study & Research** - Understanding the concepts and patterns
2. **Design & Architecture** - Planning before coding
3. **Implementation** - Building with best practices
4. **Testing & Validation** - Ensuring quality and correctness
5. **Documentation** - Making knowledge shareable
6. **Iteration** - Continuous improvement
